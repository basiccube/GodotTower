This hasn't been worked on since 2023/early 2024. The reason is simple: this is a buggy and broken mess that is awful to play, and also isn't worth it to try and fix it up.  
I have no plans to come back to it any time soon, and I wouldn't want to anyway - it's the same reason why I stopped working on it in the first place.

    Godot Tower is a work-in-progress port/rewrite of Pizza Tower (SAGE 2019 demo) in Godot Engine (3.x).
</p>

## Info

The goal of Godot Tower is to recreate the Pizza Tower SAGE 2019 demo in Godot Engine. In addition to it being a port/recreation of the SAGE 2019 demo, it also aims to be a mod focused on cut content and early versions of content that did make it into the game.  
In its current state, while it does work and is playable, it is very buggy, primarily due to various differences between Godot and GameMaker.

## How was this done?

This is done by rewriting the original demo's code in GDScript. Obviously, the code simply rewritten won't fully work properly due to various functions missing and differences between GameMaker and Godot in general. Making the code work as intended requires a lot of guesswork and also fixing the rewritten code, with anything collision related being the hardest part of making it work properly.
